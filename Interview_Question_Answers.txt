1. What is encapsulation?
Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) into a single unit, i.e., a class. It helps in data hiding and abstraction.

2. How to use an ArrayList?
ArrayList is a dynamic array in Java. It allows adding, removing, and accessing elements using methods like add(), get(), remove(), etc.

3. How to remove/update from ArrayList?
You can remove using remove(index) or remove(object), and update using set(index, newValue).

4. Difference between class and object?
A class is a blueprint or template. An object is an instance of a class.

5. How are classes related to encapsulation?
Classes allow grouping related data and methods, and by making variables private and using getters/setters, we achieve encapsulation.

6. What is an ArrayList in Java?
ArrayList is a class in Java that implements the List interface. It is a resizable array that can grow or shrink dynamically.

7. Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
ArrayList is better for random access and stores elements in contiguous memory. LinkedList is better for frequent insertions/deletions but slower for access.

8. What is the role of 'this' keyword?
The 'this' keyword refers to the current object. It is used to differentiate between instance variables and method parameters.

9. What are constructors?
Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects. They have the same name as the class and no return type.

10. Can we overload constructors and accessors?
Yes. Constructors and accessors (getters/setters) can be overloaded by changing their parameter list.
